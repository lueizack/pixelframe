What is Pixelframe?

Pixelframe is a simple, fast image gallery which looks good while doing its job.
Using the new-fangled magic of Ajax and PHP at the back, Pixelframe lets people
browse your photos painlessly and quickly.

What do I need to run Pixelframe?

Pixelframe is designed for all kinds of servers. We know everyone does not have
access to a database, so Pixelframe doesn't need one! So all you need to run PF is a webserver supporting PHP.

 -----------------

Pixelframe's aim is to be simple and lightweight. As such all steps from installation, administration to deletion should be simple, requiring minimum input from the user.

== Installation ==
Installation should involve extracting the archive to a suitable directory and running a setup script to do initialisation. The setup script should ask for the theme, and any setting required.

== Admin ==
The admin script should have the following actions:

 => Add Gallery
 => Remove Gallery
 => Change Settings (theme etc)
 
    === Add Gallery ===
    The add gallery control panel should ask the user for the directory where the images are kept. It should make sure it has read/write permissions to the directory.
    Then it should generate thumbnails of the images (use GD or similar) and ask the user if he would like to add captions. In this case he should be shown all the images, and captions added to the one's he wants.
    
    ===Remove gallery ===
    The script should ask the user if he is absolutely sure. Also the following options must be given:
        -> Delete only Pixelframe settings
        -> Delete Pf settings and thumbnails
        -> Delete everything(including the directory)
        
    === Change settings ===
    Settings involve:
        => theme
        => dir within galleries to store thumbnails in
        
== Interface ==
The user interface for browsing galleries should be like:

A bar across the top showing the thumbnails.

Previous and Next buttons.

The view window

A small notice about pixelframe.

== Backend ==
The backend apart from the setup and admin scripts will need:

A script to generate thumbnails - pf_thumbnail.php
A script to read and write XML config files - pf_configrw.php

The MAIN script which generates the UI - pixelframe.php?gallery = 

A script which will respond to Ajax requests from the client and do the needful - pf_requesthandler.php

Any more scripts as needed

== Frontend ==
Javascript:
 Files from Juice for effects and utilities
 Script to communicate with the server
 Script to modify the UI as required
 
CSS:
 The theme stylesheet
 
== Themes ==

Themes should consist of a CSS file ( style.css ) defining the design and layout of the page. All images should be contained in the images directory.
In addition every theme should contain a theme.pft file which is a plain text file like so:
Name = MyTheme
Author = Nikhil
Homepage = http://www.mytheme.com

=== Walkthrough ===

Installation:
The user extracted the files to a directory.

Running setup.php:
    First setup.php checks if it has write access to the installation path. Otherwise whine and die.
    
    If successful
    Questions:
    1. Theme
    2. Subdir to store thumbnails in
    3. Thumbnail size
    4. Password for settings
